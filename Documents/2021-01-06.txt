Hello sir,
  i have stated the day with the revision of yesterday and then i worked on the error type and how it solve it.for instance yesterday's session many intern have the error like vim editor so, i have learned setup of git 
  then i have lerned different command that i mentioned below
  1>  touch
  2>  git checkout filename (recover purpose)
  3>  git checkout -f (recover purpose)
  4>  git commit and git commit -a -m "msg"
  5>  git log 
  6>  git diff and git diff --staged
  7>  ls  and git ls-files
  8>  .gitignore folder
  9>  git status -s
  10> git pull
  11> git rm --cached 
  12> git revert

and then i heard tommorow about the conflict,
so, i imagine that situation and explore about it web refference : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/161813/how-to-resolve-merge-conflicts-in-git-repository
and also discuss the many scenario in conflict.

after the q&a session i revise everything and practice all the command in git bash.
and the refer tutorial : https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/inspecting-a-repository/git-tag
  
Thanks
