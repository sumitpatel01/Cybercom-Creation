today, i started my day with the js basics which was given by cybercom team.
and i have practiced it with the video and tried many way with the debugging in the console 
and refer datatype, and operater precedence, mutation and coercion.

after i came into the task and i have done all the thing perfectly and send the git repo.
and then i keep doing the html task but i haven't gone good in css.so, i tried many way to explore it.and finally i have completed it.

i faced lot of difficulties in css. but slowly improved and i am working in it.
