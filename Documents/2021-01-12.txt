today , I started my day with the video tutorial of javascript and along this tutorial i have practiced with the concept and
 that is added in the javascript branch's practice folder. and after that i have been practicing on css and html.
 after meeting i have paused javascript in the chrome and practiced with the noscript tag. it running and this code is attached in the html branch's practice folder.
 and also ma'am told us the pwa(progressive web app). so, i read about this.and i also see the different of local storage and session storage.
   local storage : it stores file locally and for destroy it we have to execute command.
   session storage : it is basicaly storage of the browser session. after closing the browser the session storage is removed.

   thanks :)
